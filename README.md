**ABURobocon2020**

MATLAB Implemented Modules during ABU Robocon 2020

Worked on real-time color detection, tracking, Dynamic models.
Hardware devices: Arduino, Sensors, Actuators, Pneumatic Cylinders, and Rasberry Pi. Used OpenCV, MATLAB and Simulink.

**Simscape:**

Different dynamic models were made for different plant models.
Different parameters such as
- Collision parameters between ball and ground.
- Collision parameters between different robot parts.
- Fricition parameters between different joints.
- Internal loss parameters in pneumatic cylinders.
